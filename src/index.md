# What is Metaflow Blueprints?

:::warning Work In Progress!
Metaflow Blueprints is still highly experimental and subject to change.
:::

Metaflow Blueprints aims to make integrati. The status quo for standing up external integrations is largely a draw the owl excersize where there are no examples out in the wild, nor in the documentation, and a lot of the slack advice explains how to do it but but leaves it there.

You can find the Metaflow Blueprints repository at [bcgalvin/metaflow-blueprints](https://github.com/bcgalvin/metaflow-blueprints).

:::tip Prerequisites
The documentation assumes basic familiarity with the AWS CDK. If you are totally new, we recommend visiting the [Official AWS CDK Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) page.
